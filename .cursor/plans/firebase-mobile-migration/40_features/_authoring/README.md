# Feature authoring (process + templates)

This folder is the **single home** for documents that explain **how to produce `40_features/*` specs**.

- Canonical workflow: `feature_speccing_workflow.md`
- Canonical templates: `templates/`

If you find “how to write feature specs” guidance elsewhere in the migration doc set, it should be **moved here** (or linked here and deleted).
