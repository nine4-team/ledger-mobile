# Category-scoped access control (Roles v2)

This doc has moved to a “feature-style” cross-cutting spec set:

- Spec: `40_features/_cross_cutting/category-scoped-permissions-v2/feature_spec.md`
- Plan (phased implementation): `40_features/_cross_cutting/category-scoped-permissions-v2/plan.md`
- Prompt packs (one chat per phase): `40_features/_cross_cutting/category-scoped-permissions-v2/prompt_packs/`

This file remains as a stable link target for older references.
