# Architecture (`10_architecture/`)

Architecture-level docs and invariants.

Notes:
- The canonical sync engine spec currently lives at the root as `sync_engine_spec.plan.md` (link to it rather than duplicating).

Put docs here like:
- `target_system_architecture.md`
- `security_model.md`
- `offline_first_principles.md`
