# Ledger development defaults

- Normal app launches and manual QA must use the production Firebase backend.
- Build and run the plain `LedgeriOS` scheme for iOS Simulator or macOS testing.
- Do not set `USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=1` or run the `LedgeriOS (Emulator)` scheme unless the user explicitly requests Firebase-emulator testing or a focused integration test requires it.
- Before handing off a locally launched app, verify that the process environment does not enable Firebase emulators.
